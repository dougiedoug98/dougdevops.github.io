# About Me

Hey, I'm Douglas — a systems analyst and lifelong tech enthusiast with over a decade of hands-on experience building home servers, automating processes, and supporting enterprise networks.

I started tinkering with technology at 15 and never stopped. From designing robust on-prem infrastructure to dabbling in cybersecurity and automation, I enjoy solving real-world problems with code, strategy, and precision.

My current focus is pivoting deeper into cybersecurity and DevOps, where I can apply my skills in automation, patching, and network management on a larger scale.
